Giza cubits? lunations? after determining the slant height of the monumental buildings at Giza, I had the idea to investigate cubits units = lunations equivalence with astronomy, and the result is [GizaCubitsAstronomy.md](./GizaCubitsAstronomy.md); then I created an observation schedule (for dynamically growing but sticky windows) for the ~alignment of Jupiter (tropical) with ~equinoxes, using well-preserved coffin inscriptions, and the result can be found in [GizaCubitsAlignments.md](./GizaCubitsAlignments.md); eventually, after searching for unique properties (notwithstanding windows dynnamic length) of three consecutive windows in the observation schedule, that result was put here: [GizaCubitsLeapDays.md](GizaCubitsLeapDays.md).
