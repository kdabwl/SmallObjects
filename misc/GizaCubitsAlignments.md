Jupiter? equinox? the luminaries and stars form a dynamic window that becomes larger the further the current center of the window moves away from the initial observation date; the increasing window length and its limitation are a necessary consequence of the decision to align the maximum window length with the equinoxes; however, the most important 2 consequences of these considerations are, 1) the windows can cover ever more drift over time, and 2) that all conceivable windows share one and the same boundary, meaning that over the course of a year, an observer is always in all windows simultaneously, because the edge of the n-fold simultaneous window/s is fixed by the position of a single celestial body: Jupiter (in relation to some equinox).
