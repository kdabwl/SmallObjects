# Giza Window to Lunation and Celestial Alignment Rundown

## (1 Cubit = 1 Lunation ≈ 29.53059 Days), countering Neugebauer’s nescience

| **Window from k×(T) Step to k×Jupiter Period (Lunations) [Window Size]** | **Observed and Aligned Phenomena (Lunations Rounded to Syzygy)** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **k=1: 146.5 to 146.715 [2/9]**<br>146.5 × 1 ≈ 146.5, 146.715 × 1 ≈ 146.715 | Lunar phase shift (~6.35 days drift) aligned with Jupiter near-return, observed via (T) step initiation (146.5 lunations). |
| **k=2: 293 to 293.43 [3/7]**<br>146.5 × 2 ≈ 293, 146.715 × 2 ≈ 293.43 | Regular lunar eclipses always possible, twin lunar eclipses possible (~3.2 days node drift), with 2nd sibling preferred for better anomaly alignment future (293.5 lunations). |
| **k=3: 439.5 to 440.145 [1/5]**<br>146.5 × 3 ≈ 439.5, 146.715 × 3 ≈ 440.145 | Lunar standstill cycle (~6.45 days drift) aligned with Jupiter ~3 orbits, observed seasonal horizon shift (440 lunations). |
| **k=4: 586 to 586.86 [4/5]**<br>146.5 × 4 ≈ 586, 146.715 × 4 ≈ 586.86 | Opposition of descending to ascending nodes (~0.86 lunations ≈ ½ lunation drift) aligned with Jupiter ~4 orbits, observed (s) at serpent (D) tail (587 lunations). |
| **k=5: 732.5 to 733.575 [1/2]**<br>146.5 × 5 ≈ 732.5, 146.715 × 5 ≈ 733.575 | Lunar anomaly growth (~25.4 days drift) aligned with Jupiter ~5 orbits, observed eclipse magnitude shift (733 lunations). |
| **k=10: 1465 to 1467.15 [2/9]**<br>146.5 × 10 ≈ 1465, 146.715 × 10 ≈ 1467.15 | Multiple lunar cycles (~74 days drift) aligned with Jupiter ~10 orbits, observed long-term horizon pattern (1467 lunations). |
| **k=36: 5274 to 5285.74 [7/9]**<br>146.5 × 36 ≈ 5274, 146.715 × 36 ≈ 5285.74 | Full 36-step cycle (~7.74 lunations ≈ 1 semester drift) aligned with Jupiter ~36 orbits, observed equinox alignment and twin lunar pairs (5285.5 lunations). |
